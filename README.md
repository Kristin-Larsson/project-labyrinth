# Project Labyrinth
This week we used react and redux to create a labyrinth game. We used a thunk to fetch API's and styled everything with styled components.

## The problem
It was a challenge to understand how everything connected in the code, which made it difficult to do a thorough plan in the beginning. We sorted out what styled components we needed and how the design should look like. But the backend was a lot of trial and error, but in the end we made it work. 

With more time we could add a map that describes each step the player has taken and to make it more immersive adding more animations to the interface. Like fades between screens and events that illustrates what happens in the story.
